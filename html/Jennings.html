            <h2><span class="text-larger">Thomas Jennings</span> the Business Man</h2>
            <p> Thomas Jennings was born January 1st, 1791. He was born in New York City
               a free black man. He was born free at a time period where most 
               African-Americans were slaves. When he turned 20, he started working
               as a tailor. He became really good at it and people from far away
               would ask him to improve on their clothes. As a tailor, people also
               complained to him about their clothes getting stains and asking him for 
               advice so he came up with something called dry scouring. He applied for a patent
               and it was given to him in 1821. He was the first African-American to get a patent.
               He would become even more famous for this product. Unfortunetly, a few years later,
               the patent was burned in a fire but luckly he was famous enough for everybody to 
               know he made it. After this invention, he got quite a bit of money and became an 
               abolitionist.

            <h2><span class="text-larger">Thomas Jennings</span> the Abolitionist</h2>
            <p> After Thomas Jennings got more money, he bought his family out of enslavement. He became an activist for the rights of people of colour creating a company/organization to fight for minority rights. He founded this company partially to help his daughter who was taken off the streetcar for sitting in the whites only section. He organized her defense and a movement against public transit. His daughter would go on and win her case in court and around a decade later, all streetcars stopped having black and white sections. Thomas Jennings would continue to be an abolitionist until he died on February 12, 1856. He woud end up passing away 9 years before the 13th amendment but he was one of the biggest fighters for the abolition of slavery.

            <h2><span class="text-larger">Thomas Jennings</span> the Affect</h2>
            <p> Thomas Jennings was not only a great inventor and tailor but he is a big milestone in history. People would have to wait another 14 years before another African-American got a patent. 
               Thomas jennings not only invented a new business but he could have inspired many African-Americans to invent things and he could also have inspired African-Americans apply for a patent. 
               After his death, dry cleaning continued to thrive to today. Now, the dry cleaning market is worth over 60 Billion dollars. (Daniel could still easily buy whole market though.) :)
