            <p> Racism to African American inventors has always been happening, especially 
               in the 1800s. Many African-Americans were slaves and as slaves, they
            were not considered as citizens therefore unable to get patents for 
         their invention. For that reason, their owners would usually take  
         credit for their invention(s).</p>
               <p> Granville Woods is a African-American inventor who faked being
                  half Indian half Australian so he would not face as much racism.

           <p>Other forms of racism to Black inventors include people working
              in the US Trademark and Pattent Office putting aside a lot of these 
              pattent requests and usually do them a lot later. Black people would 
              also have to go throught a extensive process to get their pattent 
              which was also costly so a lot of black people could not pay for it 
              and it was also hard for them to raise money.

        <div class="testimonial bg-primary">
         <p> To not face racism and heavy scrutiny, African-American people would 
            tend to either, completely deny the fact that they were black and use 
            other countries out of Africa like India. They could also get a white 
            person to submit the pattent for them or just not get a pattent which 
            did not protect them from copiers.
